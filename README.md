# Requirements and timing
All analyses were run in the R (version 4.4.2) programming language or on Python via Google Colab (which provides a ready-to-use Python environment). Installing R usually takes less than 30 minutes, but may vary. Installing the necessary R packages takes usually 1-2 minutes per package, unless packages are installed from source which takes longer.
